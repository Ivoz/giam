\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the relation $\relA$ defined by 
$ \relA = \{ (x,y) \suchthat \; x \, \mbox{has the same astrological sign as} \, y \}$.  Show that $\relA$ is an equivalence relation.  What equivalence class
under $\relA$ do you belong to?
\item Define a relation $\square$ on the integers by $x \square y \; \iff x^2 = y^2$.  Show that $\square$ is an equivalence relation.  List the equivalence
classes $x/\square$ for $0 \leq x \leq 5$.
\item Define a relation $\relA$ on the set of all words by

\[ w_1 \relA w_2 \quad \iff \quad w_1 \mbox{ is an anagram of } w_2. \]

\noindent Show that $\relA$ is an equivalence relation.  (Words are anagrams
if the letters of one can be re-arranged to form the other.  For example, `ART' and `RAT' are anagrams.)
\item The two diagrams below both show a famous graph known as the 
\index{Petersen graph}Petersen graph.  The picture on the 
left is the usual representation which emphasizes its five-fold symmetry.  The picture on the right
highlights the fact that the Petersen graph also has a three-fold symmetry.  Label the right-hand diagram
using the same letters (A through J) in order to show that these two representations are truly isomorphic.

\item We will use the symbol $\Integers^{\ast}$ to refer to the set of
all integers \emph{except} $0$.  
Define a relation $\relQ$ on the set of all pairs in $\Integers \times \Integers^{\ast}$ (pairs of integers where the second coordinate is non-zero) by
$(a,b) \relQ (c,d) \; \iff \; ad=bc$.  Show that $\relQ$ is an 
equivalence relation.

\item The relation $\relQ$ defined in the previous problem partitions
the set of all pairs of integers into an interesting set of equivalence
classes.  Explain why 

\[ \Rationals \quad = \quad (\Integers \times \Integers^{\ast}) / \relQ. \]

\noindent Ultimately, this is the ``right'' definition of the set 
of rational numbers!

\item Reflect back on the proof in problem 5.  Note that we were fairly
careful in assuring that the second coordinate in the ordered pairs is
non-zero. (This was the whole reason for introducing the 
$\Integers^{\ast}$ notation.)  At what point in the argument did you
use this hypothesis?

\section{Ordering relations}

\begin{enumerate}
\item In population ecology there is a partial order ``predates''
which basically means that one organism feeds upon another.  Strictly
speaking this relation is not transitive; however, if we take the point
of view that when a wolf eats a sheep, it is also eating some of the grass
that the sheep has fed upon, we see that in a certain sense it is transitive.
A chain in this partial order is called a ``food chain'' and so-called 
apex predators are said to ``sit atop the food chain''.  Thus ``apex 
predator'' is a term for a maximal element in this poset.   When poisons
such as mercury and PCBs are introduced into an ecosystem, they tend to
collect disproportionately in the apex predators -- which is why pregnant
women and young children should not eat sharks or tuna but sardines 
are fine.

Below is a small example of an ecology partially ordered by ``predates''

\item The graph of the edges of a cube is one in an infinite sequence of 
graphs.  These graphs are defined 
recursively by ``Make two copies of the previous graph then join 
corresponding nodes in the two copies with edges.''  The $0$-dimensional
`cube' is just a single point.  The $1$-dimensional cube is a single edge
with a node at either end.  The $2$-dimensional cube is actually a square
and the $3$-dimensional cube is what we usually mean when we say ``cube.''

Make a careful drawing of a \index{hypercube}\emph{hypercube} -- which is
the name of the graph that follows the ordinary cube in this sequence.

\item Label the nodes of a hypercube with the divisors of $210$ in order to
produce a Hasse diagram of the poset determined by the divisibility relation.

\item Label the nodes of a hypercube with the subsets of $\{a,b,c,d\}$ 
in order to produce a Hasse diagram of the poset determined by the 
subset containment relation.
  
\item Complete a Hasse diagram for the poset of divisors of 11025 (partially ordered by divisibility).

\item Find a collection of sets so that, when they are partially ordered by $\subseteq$, we obtain the same Hasse diagram as in the previous problem.

\section{Functions}
\label{sec:functions}


\noindent{\large \bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}

\item For each of the following functions, give its domain, range and a possible codomain.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $f(x) = \sin{(x)}$
  \item $g(x) = e^x$
  \item $h(x) = x^2$
  \item $m(x) = \frac{x^2+1}{x^2-1}$
  \item $n(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor$
  \item $p(x) = \langle \cos{(x)}, \sin{(x)} \rangle $
  \end{enumerate}

\item Find a bijection from the set of odd squares, $\{1, 9, 25, 49, \ldots\}$,
to the non-negative integers, $\Znoneg = \{0,1,2,3, \ldots\}$.
Prove that the function you just determined is both injective and surjective.
Find the inverse function of the bijection above.

\item The natural logarithm function $\ln (x)$ is defined by a definite
integral with the variable $x$ in the upper limit.

\[ \ln (x) = \int_{t=1}^{x} \frac{1}{t} \, \mbox{d}t. \]

From this definition we can deduce that $\ln (x)$ is strictly increasing on its
entire domain, $(0, \infty)$.  Why is this true?

We can use the above definition with $x=2$ to find the value of 
$\ln (2) \approx .693$.  We will also take as given the following 
rule (which is valid for all logarithmic functions).

\[ \ln(a^b) = b \ln(a) \]

Use the above information to show that there is neither an upper bound 
nor a lower bound for the values of the natural logarithm.  These facts
together with the information that $\ln$ is strictly increasing show that
$\Rng{\ln} = \Reals$.
 
\item Georg Cantor developed a systematic way of listing the rational numbers.
By ``listing'' a set one is actually developing a bijection from $\Naturals$ to
that set.  The method known as ``Cantor's Snake'' creates a bijection from
the naturals to the non-negative rationals.  
First we create an infinite table whose rows
are indexed by positive integers and whose columns are indexed by non-negative
integers -- the entries in this table are rational numbers of the form
``column index'' / ``row index.''  We then follow a snake-like path that
zig-zags across this table -- whenever we encounter a rational number that 
we haven't seen before (in lower terms) we write it down.  This is indicated 
in the diagram below by circling the entries.   

Effectively this gives us a function $f$ which produces the rational number 
that would be found in a given position in this list.  For example 
$f(1) = 0/1, f(2) = 1/1$ and $f(5) = 1/3$.  

What is $f(26)$?  What is $f(30)$?  What is $f^{-1}(3/4)$? What is $f^{-1}(6/7)$?

\section{Special functions}
\label{sec:special_functions}


\noindent{\large \bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}

\item The $n$-th triangular number, denoted $T(n)$, is given by the formula
$T(n) = (n^2 + n)/2$. If we regard this formula as a function from $\Reals$ to
$\Reals$, it fails the horizontal line test and so it is not invertible. Find a
suitable restriction so that T is invertible.

\item The usual algebraic procedure for inverting $T(x) = (x^2+x)/2$ fails. Use
your knowledge of the geometry of functions and their inverses to find
a formula for the inverse. (Hint: it may be instructive to first invert
the simpler formula $S(x) = x^2/2$ --- this will get you the right vertical
scaling factor.)

\item What is $\pi_2(W(t))$?  

\item Find a right inverse for $f(x) = |x|$.

\item In three-dimensional space we have projection functions that go onto
the three coordinate axes ($\pi_1$, $\pi_2$ and $\pi_3$) and we also have
projections onto coordinate planes.  For example,
$\pi_{12}: \Reals \times \Reals \times \Reals \longrightarrow \Reals \times \Reals$, defined by

\[ \pi_{12}((x,y,z)) = (x,y) \]

\noindent is the projection onto the $x$--$y$ coordinate plane.

The triple of functions  $(\cos{t}, \sin{t}, t)$ is a parametric
expression for a helix.  Let 
$H = \{ (\cos{t}, \sin{t}, t) \suchthat t \in \Reals \}$ be the set of all
points on the helix.  What is the set $\pi_{12}(H)$ ?  What are the
sets $\pi_{13}(H)$ and $\pi_{23}(H)$?

\item Consider the set $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\}$.  Express the characteristic
function of the subset $S = \{1, 2, 3 \}$ as a set of ordered pairs.

\item If $S$ and $T$ are subsets of a set $D$, what is the product of
their characteristic functions $1_S \cdot 1_T$ ?

\item Evaluate the sum

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{10} \frac{1}{i} \cdot [ i \; \mbox{is prime} ]. \]
