\begin{enumerate}

\item Use the binomial theorem (with $x=1000$ and $y=1$) to calculate
$1001^6$.

\item Find $(2x+3)^5$.

\item Find $(x^2+y^2)^6$.

\item The following diagram contains a 3-dimensional analog of
Pascal's triangle that we might call ``Pascal's tetrahedron.'' 
What would the next layer look like?

\item The student government at Lagrange High consists of 24 members chosen
from amongst the general student body of 210. Additionally, there
is a steering committee of 5 members chosen from amongst those in
student government. Use the multiplication rule to determine two different
formulas for the total number of possible governance structures.

\item Prove the identity
\[ \binom{n}{k} \cdot \binom{k}{r} \; = \; \binom{n}{r} \cdot \binom{n-r}{k-r} \]
combinatorially.

\item Prove the binomial theorem.

\[ \forall n \in \Naturals, \; \forall x,y \in \Reals, \; 
(x+y)^n \; = \; \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} x^{n-k}y^k \]
