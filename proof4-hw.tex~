\section{Morley's miracle}


\noindent{\large \bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}
\item What value should we get if we sum all of the
angles that appear around one of the interior vertices in the 
finished diagram?  Verify that all three have the correct sum.

\item In this section we talked about similarity.  Two figures in 
the plane are 
similar if it is possible to turn one into the other
by a sequence of mappings: a translation, a rotation and a scaling.  

Geometric similarity is an equivalence relation.  To fix our
notation, let $T(x,y)$ represent a generic translation, $R(x,y)$ a rotation
and $S(x,y)$ a scaling -- thus a generic similarity is a function from
$\Reals^2$ to $\Reals^2$ that can be written in the form $S(R(T(x,y)))$.

Discuss the three properties of an equivalence relation (reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity) in terms of geometric similarity.

\section{Five steps into the void}


\noindent{\large \bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}
\item Do the algebra (and show all your work!) to prove that invariant
defined in this section actually has the value 1 for the set of all the
men occupying the $x$-axis and the lower half-plane.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Monge's circle theorem}



\noindent{\large \bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}
\item There is a scenario where the proof we have sketched for
Monge's circle theorem doesn't really work.  Can you envision it?
Hint: consider two relatively large spheres and one that is quite
small.
\end{enumerate}
