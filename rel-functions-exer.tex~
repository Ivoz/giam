\item For each of the following functions, give its domain, range and a possible codomain.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $f(x) = \sin{(x)}$
  \item $g(x) = e^x$
  \item $h(x) = x^2$
  \item $m(x) = \frac{x^2+1}{x^2-1}$
  \item $n(x) = \lfloor x \rfloor$
  \item $p(x) = \langle \cos{(x)}, \sin{(x)} \rangle $
  \end{enumerate}

\item Find a bijection from the set of odd squares, $\{1, 9, 25, 49, \ldots\}$,
to the non-negative integers, $\Znoneg = \{0,1,2,3, \ldots\}$.
Prove that the function you just determined is both injective and surjective.
Find the inverse function of the bijection above.

\item The natural logarithm function $\ln (x)$ is defined by a definite
integral with the variable $x$ in the upper limit.

\[ \ln (x) = \int_{t=1}^{x} \frac{1}{t} \, \mbox{d}t. \]

From this definition we can deduce that $\ln (x)$ is strictly increasing on its
entire domain, $(0, \infty)$.  Why is this true?

We can use the above definition with $x=2$ to find the value of 
$\ln (2) \approx .693$.  We will also take as given the following 
rule (which is valid for all logarithmic functions).

\[ \ln(a^b) = b \ln(a) \]

Use the above information to show that there is neither an upper bound 
nor a lower bound for the values of the natural logarithm.  These facts
together with the information that $\ln$ is strictly increasing show that
$\Rng{\ln} = \Reals$.
 
\item Georg Cantor developed a systematic way of listing the rational numbers.
By ``listing'' a set one is actually developing a bijection from $\Naturals$ to
that set.  The method known as ``Cantor's Snake'' creates a bijection from
the naturals to the non-negative rationals.  
First we create an infinite table whose rows
are indexed by positive integers and whose columns are indexed by non-negative
integers -- the entries in this table are rational numbers of the form
``column index'' / ``row index.''  We then follow a snake-like path that
zig-zags across this table -- whenever we encounter a rational number that 
we haven't seen before (in lower terms) we write it down.  This is indicated 
in the diagram below by circling the entries.   

Effectively this gives us a function $f$ which produces the rational number 
that would be found in a given position in this list.  For example 
$f(1) = 0/1, f(2) = 1/1$ and $f(5) = 1/3$.  

What is $f(26)$?  What is $f(30)$?  What is $f^{-1}(3/4)$? What is $f^{-1}(6/7)$?

\begin{enumerate}

\item The $n$-th triangular number, denoted $T(n)$, is given by the formula
$T(n) = (n^2 + n)/2$. If we regard this formula as a function from $\Reals$ to
$\Reals$, it fails the horizontal line test and so it is not invertible. Find a
suitable restriction so that T is invertible.

\item The usual algebraic procedure for inverting $T(x) = (x^2+x)/2$ fails. Use
your knowledge of the geometry of functions and their inverses to find
a formula for the inverse. (Hint: it may be instructive to first invert
the simpler formula $S(x) = x^2/2$ --- this will get you the right vertical
scaling factor.)

\item What is $\pi_2(W(t))$?  

\item Find a right inverse for $f(x) = |x|$.

\item In three-dimensional space we have projection functions that go onto
the three coordinate axes ($\pi_1$, $\pi_2$ and $\pi_3$) and we also have
projections onto coordinate planes.  For example,
$\pi_{12}: \Reals \times \Reals \times \Reals \longrightarrow \Reals \times \Reals$, defined by

\[ \pi_{12}((x,y,z)) = (x,y) \]

\noindent is the projection onto the $x$--$y$ coordinate plane.

The triple of functions  $(\cos{t}, \sin{t}, t)$ is a parametric
expression for a helix.  Let 
$H = \{ (\cos{t}, \sin{t}, t) \suchthat t \in \Reals \}$ be the set of all
points on the helix.  What is the set $\pi_{12}(H)$ ?  What are the
sets $\pi_{13}(H)$ and $\pi_{23}(H)$?

\item Consider the set $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\}$.  Express the characteristic
function of the subset $S = \{1, 2, 3 \}$ as a set of ordered pairs.

\item If $S$ and $T$ are subsets of a set $D$, what is the product of
their characteristic functions $1_S \cdot 1_T$ ?

\item Evaluate the sum

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{10} \frac{1}{i} \cdot [ i \; \mbox{is prime} ]. \]
