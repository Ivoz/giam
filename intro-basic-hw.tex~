\label{sec:basic}

\noindent{\large \bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}

\item Each of the quantities indexing the rows of the following table
is in one or more of the sets which index the columns.  Place a 
check mark in a table entry if the quantity is in the set.

\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
 & $\Naturals$ & $\Integers$ & $\Rationals$ & $\Reals$ & $\Complexes$
 \\ \hline\hline
\rule{0pt}{15pt} $17$ & & & & & \\ \hline
\rule{0pt}{15pt} $\pi$ & & & & & \\ \hline
\rule{0pt}{15pt} $22/7$ & & & & & \\ \hline
\rule{0pt}{15pt} $-6$ & & & & & \\ \hline
\rule{0pt}{15pt} $e^0$ & & & & & \\ \hline
\rule{0pt}{15pt} $1+i$ & & & & & \\ \hline
\rule{0pt}{15pt} $\sqrt{3}$ & & & & & \\ \hline
\rule{0pt}{15pt} $i^2$ & & & & & \\  \hline
\end{tabular}

\item Write the set $\Integers$ of integers using a singly infinite
listing.

\item Identify each as rational or irrational.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $5021.2121212121\ldots$
\item $0.2340000000\ldots$
\item $12.31331133311133331111\ldots$
\item $\pi$
\item $2.987654321987654321987654321\ldots$
\end{enumerate}

\item The ``see and say'' sequence is produced by first writing a 1, 
then iterating the following procedure:  look at the previous entry 
and say how many entries there are of each integer and write down what 
you just said.  The first several terms of the ``see and say'' sequence 
are $1, 11, 21, 1112, 3112, 211213, 312213, 212223, \ldots$.  Comment on the
rationality (or irrationality) the the number whose decimal digits are got 
by concatenating the ``see and say'' sequence.

\item Give a description of the set of rational numbers whose decimal
expansions terminate.  (Alternatively, you may think of their decimal
expansions ending in an infinitely-long string of zeros.)

\item Find the first 20 decimal places of $\pi$, $3/7$, $\sqrt{2}$, 
  $2/5$, $16/17$, $\sqrt{3}$, $1/2$ and $42/100$.  Classify each of
these quantity's decimal expansion as: terminating, having a repeating
pattern, or showing no discernible pattern.
 
\item Consider the process of long division.  Does this algorithm give
any insight as to why rational numbers have terminating or repeating
decimal expansions?  Explain.

\item Give an argument as to why the product of two rational numbers
is again a rational.



\item Perform the following computations with complex numbers

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \rule{0pt}{20pt}$ (4 + 3i) - (3 + 2i) $
  \item \rule{0pt}{20pt}$ (1 + i) + (1 - i) $
  \item \rule{0pt}{20pt}$ (1 + i) \cdot (1 - i) $
  \item \rule{0pt}{20pt}$ (2 - 3i) \cdot (3 - 2i) $
  \end{enumerate}

\item The {\em conjugate} of a complex number is denoted with a
  superscript star, and is formed by negating the imaginary part.
  Thus if $z = 3+ 4i$ then the conjugate of $z$ is  $z^\ast = 3-4i$.
  Give an argument as to why the product of a complex number and its
  conjugate is a real quantity.  (I.e. the imaginary part of
  $z\cdot z^\ast$ is necessarily 0, no matter what complex number is
  used for $z$.)

\section{Definitions: Prime numbers}
\label{sec:def}

\noindent{\large\bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}

\item Find the prime factorizations of the following integers.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item 105
  \item 414
  \item 168
  \item 1612
  \item 9177
  \end{enumerate}

\item Use the sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers
up to 100.

\begin{tabular}{cccccccccc}
\rule{14pt}{0pt} & \rule{14pt}{0pt} & \rule{14pt}{0pt} &
\rule{14pt}{0pt} & \rule{14pt}{0pt} & \rule{14pt}{0pt} & 
\rule{14pt}{0pt} & \rule{14pt}{0pt} & \rule{14pt}{0pt} &
\rule{14pt}{0pt} \\
 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\
 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 \\
 21 & 22 & 23 & 24 & 25 & 26 & 27 & 28 & 29 & 30 \\
 31 & 32 & 33 & 34 & 35 & 36 & 37 & 38 & 39 & 40 \\
 41 & 42 & 43 & 44 & 45 & 46 & 47 & 48 & 49 & 50 \\
 51 & 52 & 53 & 54 & 55 & 56 & 57 & 58 & 59 & 60 \\ 
 61 & 62 & 63 & 64 & 65 & 66 & 67 & 68 & 69 & 70 \\
 71 & 72 & 73 & 74 & 75 & 76 & 77 & 78 & 79 & 80 \\
 81 & 82 & 83 & 84 & 85 & 86 & 87 & 88 & 89 & 90 \\
 91 & 92 & 93 & 94 & 95 & 96 & 97 & 98 & 99 & 100
\end{tabular}

\item What would be the largest prime one would sieve with
in order to find all primes up to 400?

\item Complete the following table which is related to 
Conjecture~\ref{conj:ferm}.

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
$p$ & $2^p-1$ & prime? & factors \\ \hline
2 & 3 & yes & 1 and 3 \\
3 & 7 & yes & 1 and 7 \\
5 & 31 & yes &  \\
7 & 127   &     &    \\
11 &   &     &    
\end{tabular}

\item Characterize the prime factorizations of numbers that are
  perfect squares.

\item Find a counterexample for Conjecture~\ref{conj:poly}.

\item Use the second definition of ``prime'' to see that $6$ is
not a prime.  In other words, find two numbers (the $a$ and $b$ 
that appear in the definition) such that $6$ is not a factor of
either, but {\em is} a factor of their product.

\item Use the second definition of ``prime'' to show that $35$ is
not a prime.

\item A famous conjecture that is thought to be true (but
for which no proof is known) is the  \index{Twin Prime conjecture}
Twin Prime conjecture.
A pair of primes is said to be twin if they differ by 2.
For example, 11 and 13 are twin primes, as are 431 and 433.
The Twin Prime conjecture states that there are an infinite
number of such twins.  Try to come up with an argument as
to why 3, 5 and 7 are the only prime triplets.

\item Another famous conjecture, also thought to be true -- but
as yet unproved, is \index{Goldbach's conjecture}
Goldbach's conjecture.  Goldbach's conjecture
states that every even number greater than 4 is the sum of two odd
primes.  There is a function $g(n)$, known as the Goldbach function, defined
on the positive integers, that gives the number of different ways to 
write a given number as the sum of two odd primes.  For example $g(10) = 2$
since $10=5+5=7+3$.  Thus another version of Goldbach's conjecture
is that $g(n)$ is positive whenever $n$ is an even number greater than
4.

Graph $g(n)$ for $6 \leq n \leq 20$.

``Everybody has \emph{some} friend that thinks they know everything about 
a sport.''
  

\item The sentence ``Every metallic element is a solid at room temperature.'' 
is false.  Why?

\section{Definitions of elementary number theory}
\label{sec:num_thry}

\noindent{\large\bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}

\item An integer $n$ is \index{doubly-even} \emph{doubly-even} 
if it is even, and the integer $m$ guaranteed to exist because 
$n$ is even is itself even.  Is 0 doubly-even?  What are the 
first 3 positive, doubly-even integers?

\item Dividing an integer by two has an interesting interpretation
when using binary notation: simply shift the digits to the right.
Thus, $22 = 10110_2$ when divided by two gives $1011_2$ which is
$8+2+1=11$.  How can you recognize a doubly-even integer from
its binary representation?

\item The \index{octal representation} \emph{octal} representation 
of an integer uses powers of 8 in place notation.  The digits of an 
octal number run from 0 to 7, one never sees 8's or 9's.  How would 
you represent 8 and 9 as octal numbers?  What octal number comes 
immediately after $777_8$?  What (decimal) number is $777_8$?

\item One method of converting from decimal to some other base is
called \index{repeated division algorithm} \emph{repeated division}.  
One divides the number by the base
and records the remainder -- one then divides the quotient obtained
by the base and records the remainder.  Continue dividing the 
successive quotients by the base until the quotient is smaller than
the base.  Convert 3267 to base-7 using repeated division.  Check 
your answer by using the meaning of base-7 place notation.  (For
example $54321_7$ means $5\cdot7^4 + 4\cdot7^3 + 3 \cdot7^2 +
2\cdot7^1 + 1\cdot7^0$.)

\item State a theorem about the octal representation of even numbers.

\item In hexadecimal (base-16) notation one needs 16 ``digits,'' the
  ordinary digits are used for 0 through 9, and the letters A through
  F are used to give single symbols for 10 through 15.  The first  32
  natural number in hexadecimal are:
  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,\newline 17,18,19,1A,
  1B,1C,1D,1E,1F,20. 

  Write the next 10 hexadecimal numbers after $AB$.

  Write the next 10 hexadecimal numbers after $FA$.

\item For conversion between the three bases used most often in 
Computer Science we can take binary as the ``standard'' base and 
convert using a table look-up.  Each octal digit will correspond 
to a binary triple, and each hexadecimal digit will correspond to 
a 4-tuple of binary numbers.  Complete the following tables.  
(As a check, the 4-tuple next to $A$ in the table for
hexadecimal should be 1010 -- which is nice since $A$ 
is really 10 so if you read that as ``ten-ten'' it is a good 
aid to memory.)

\item Use the tables above to make the following conversions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Convert $757_8$ to binary.
\item Convert $1007_8$ to hexadecimal.
\item Convert $100101010110_2$ to octal.
\item Convert $1111101000110101$ to hexadecimal.
\item Convert $FEED_{16}$ to binary.
\item Convert $FFFFFF_{16}$ to octal.
\end{enumerate}

\item It is a well known fact that if a number is divisible by 3, then 3
  divides the sum of the (decimal) digits of that number.  Is this
  result true in base 7?  Do you think this result is true in {\em
  any} base?

  a 50 pound capacity.  Write an expression using either floor or
  ceiling notation for the number of bags required.

\section{Rational and irrational numbers}
\label{sec:rat}

\noindent{\large\bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}

\item \index{Rational approximation} Rational Approximation is 
a field of mathematics that has received much study.  The main idea 
is to find rational numbers that are very good approximations to
given irrationals.  For example, $22/7$ is a well-known rational 
approximation to $\pi$.  Find good rational approximations to 
$\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}$ and $e$.

\item The theory of base-$n$ notation that we looked at in 
sub-section\ref{base-n} can be extended to deal with real and 
rational numbers by introducing a decimal point (which should 
probably be re-named in accordance with the base) and adding 
digits to the right of it.  For instance $1.1011$ is binary notation
for $1 \cdot 2^0 + 1 \cdot 2^{-1} + 0 \cdot 2^{-2} + 
1\cdot 2^{-3} + 1\cdot 2^{-4}$ or $\displaystyle 1 + \frac{1}{2} + 
\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} = 1 \frac{11}{16}$.

Consider the binary number $.1010010001000010000010000001\ldots$, 
is this number rational or irrational?  Why?

\item If a number $x$ is even, it's easy to show that its square $x^2$
is even.  The lemma that went unproved in this section asks us to
start with a square ($x^2$) that is even and deduce that the unsquared
number ($x$) is even.  Perform some numerical experimentation to
check whether this assertion is reasonable.  Can you give an argument
that would prove it?

\item The proof that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational can be generalized 
to show that $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational for every prime number $p$.
What statement would be equivalent to the lemma about the parity
of $x$ and $x^2$ in such a generalization?

\item Write a proof that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Relations}
\label{sec:rel_intro}


\noindent{\large\bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}

\item Consider the numbers from 1 to 10.  Give the set of pairs of these numbers that 
corresponds to the divisibility relation.

\item The \index{domain}\emph{domain} of a function (or binary relation) 
is the set of numbers appearing in the first coordinate.  The \index{range} 
\emph{range} of a function (or binary relation) is the set of numbers 
appearing in the second coordinate.  

Consider the set $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ and the function $f(x) = x^2 \pmod{7}$.
Express this function as a relation by explicitly writing out the set of
ordered pairs it contains.  What is the range of this function?
 
\item What relation on the numbers from 1 to 10 does the following set of ordered pairs
represent?

\begin{gather*}
\{ (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (1,10), \\
(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (2,10), \\
(3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (3,10), \\
(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (4,10), \\
(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10), \\
(6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (6,10), \\
(7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), \\
(8,8), (8,9), (8,10), \\
(9,9), (9,10), \\
(10,10) \} 
\end{gather*}

\item Draw a five-pointed star, label all 10 points. There are 40 triples of these 
labels that satisfy the betweenness relation.  List them.

\item Sketch a graph of the relation 
\[
\{ (x,y) \suchthat x,y \in \Reals \mbox{and} y > x^2 \}.
\]

\item A function $f(x)$ is said to be \index{invertible function} 
\emph{invertible} if there is another function $g(x)$ such that 
$g(f(x)) = x$ for all values of $x$.  (Usually, the inverse function,
$g(x)$ would be denoted $f^{-1}(x)$.)   Suppose a function is presented 
to you as a relation -- that is, you are just given a set of pairs.  
How can you distinguish whether the function represented by this list 
of input/output pairs is invertible?  How can you produce the inverse 
(as a set of ordered pairs)?
 
\item There is a relation known as ``has color'' which goes from the
set $F = \{orange, cherry, pumpkin, banana\}$ to the set $C = \{orange, red, green, yellow\}$.  What pairs are in ``has color''?
