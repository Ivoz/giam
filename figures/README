The source files for the figures in this directory end in .fig they must be edited with the rather antiquated XFig utility.

If changes are made to the existing graphics just run "make"

If new graphics are created you'll need to recreate the Makefile with

	fig4latex -d figures -p

then run "make"

The process of "making" the graphics for inclusion into LaTeX depends on your installation having "fig2dev" and "epstopdf".
