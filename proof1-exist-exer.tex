\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that there is a perfect square that is the sum of two
perfect squares.
\item Show that there is a perfect cube that is the sum of three
perfect cubes.
\item Show that the \index{well-ordering principle}WOP doesn't hold in the integers.  (This is an
existence proof, you show that there is a subset of $\Integers$
that doesn't have a smallest element.)
\item Show that the WOP doesn't hold in $\Rationals^+$.
\item In the proof of Theorem~\ref{gcd!exists} we weaseled out of
showing that $d \divides b$.  Fill in that part of the proof.
\item Give a proof of the unique existence of $q$ and $r$ in the
division algorithm. 
\item A \index{digraph}\emph{digraph} is a drawing containing a collection of points
that are connected by arrows.  The game known as \emph{scissors-paper-rock}
can be represented by a digraph that is \emph{balanced} (each point has the
same number of arrows going out as going in).  Show that there is a 
balanced digraph having 5 points.
