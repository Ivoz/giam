\item What would be the largest prime one would sieve with
in order to find all primes up to 400?

\newpage

\item Complete the following table which is related to 
Conjecture~\ref{conj:ferm}.

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
$p$ & $2^p-1$ & prime? & factors \\ \hline
2 & 3 & yes & 1 and 3 \\
3 & 7 & yes & 1 and 7 \\
5 & 31 & yes &  \\
7 & 127   &     &    \\
11 &   &     &    
\end{tabular}

\item Characterize the prime factorizations of numbers that are
  perfect squares.

\item Find a counterexample for \ifthenelse{\boolean{InTextBook}}{Conjecture~\ref{conj:poly}}{the conjecture that $x^2-31x+257$ evaluates to a prime number
whenever $x$ is a natural number}.

\item Use the second definition of ``prime'' to see that $6$ is
not a prime.  In other words, find two numbers (the $a$ and $b$ 
that appear in the definition) such that $6$ is not a factor of
either, but {\em is} a factor of their product.

\item Use the second definition of ``prime'' to show that $35$ is
not a prime.

\item A famous conjecture that is thought to be true (but
for which no proof is known) is the  \index{Twin Prime conjecture}
Twin Prime conjecture.
A pair of primes is said to be twin if they differ by 2.
For example, 11 and 13 are twin primes, as are 431 and 433.
The Twin Prime conjecture states that there are an infinite
number of such twins.  Try to come up with an argument as
to why 3, 5 and 7 are the only prime triplets.

\newpage

\item Another famous conjecture, also thought to be true -- but
as yet unproved, is \index{Goldbach's conjecture}
Goldbach's conjecture.  Goldbach's conjecture
states that every even number greater than 4 is the sum of two odd
primes.  There is a function $g(n)$, known as the Goldbach function, defined
on the positive integers, that gives the number of different ways to 
write a given number as the sum of two odd primes.  For example $g(10) = 2$
since $10=5+5=7+3$.  Thus another version of Goldbach's conjecture
is that $g(n)$ is positive whenever $n$ is an even number greater than
4.

Graph $g(n)$ for $6 \leq n \leq 20$.
