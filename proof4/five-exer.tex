\begin{enumerate}
\item Do the algebra (and show all your work!) to prove that invariant
defined in this section actually has the value 1 for the set of all the
men occupying the $x$-axis and the lower half-plane.

\item ``Escape of the clones'' is a  nice puzzle, originally proposed by Maxim Kontsevich.  The game
is played on an infinite checkerboard restricted to the first quadrant -- that is the squares may be 
identified with points having integer coordinates $(x,y)$ with $x>0$ and $y>0$.  The ``clones'' are markers
(checkers, coins, small rocks, whatever\ldots) that can move in only one fashion -- if the squares immediately
above and to the right of a clone are empty, then it can make a ``clone move.''   The clone moves one space
up and a copy is placed in the cell one to the right.  We begin with three clones occupying cells $(1,1), (2,1)$ and $(1,2)$ -- we'll refer to those three checkerboard squares as ``the prison.''  The question is this:  can these
three clones escape the prison?

You must either demonstrate a sequence of moves that frees all three clones or provide an argument that the task is impossible.
