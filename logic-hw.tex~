\section{Implication}
\label{sec:impl}


\noindent{\large \bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}

\item The transitive property of equality says that if $a=b$ and $b=c$
then $a=c$.  Does the implication arrow satisfy a transitive property?
If so, state it.

\item Complete truth tables for the compound sentences $A \implies B$ and
  ${\lnot}A \lor B$.

\item Complete a truth table for the compound sentence $A \implies (B \implies C)$ and for the sentence $(A \implies B) \implies C$.  What can you conclude
about conditionals and the associative property?

\item Determine a sentence using the {\em and} connector ($\land$) that
gives the negation of $A \implies B$.

\item Rewrite the sentence ``Fix the toilet or I won't pay the rent!'' as
a conditional.

\item Why is it that the sentence ``If pigs can fly, I am the king
of Mesopotamia.'' true?

\item Express the statement $A \implies B$ using the Peirce arrow and/or the
Scheffer stroke. (See Exercise~\ref{ex:nand_nor} in the previous section.)

\item Find the contrapositives of the following sentences.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.
  \item If you do well in school, you'll get a good job.
  \item If you wish others to treat you in a certain way, you must 
    treat others in that fashion.
  \item If it's raining, there must be clouds.
  \item If $a_n \leq b_n$, for all $n$ and $\sum_{n=0}^\infty b_n$ is a 
convergent series, then $\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n$ is a convergent series.
  \end{enumerate}

\item What are the converse and inverse of ``If you watch my back, I'll 
watch your back.''?

\item The integral test in Calculus is used to determine whether an
infinite series converges or diverges:   Suppose that $f(x)$ is a positive,
decreasing, 
real-valued function with $\lim_{x \longrightarrow \infty} f(x) = 0$, if
the improper integral
$\int_0^\infty f(x)$ has a finite value, then the infinite series 
$\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)$ converges.

The integral test should be envisioned by letting the series correspond
to a right-hand Riemann sum for the integral, since the function is decreasing,
a right-hand Riemann sum is an underestimate for the value of the integral,
thus

\[ \sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n) < \int_0^\infty f(x). \]

Discuss the meanings of and (where possible) provide justifications for
the inverse, converse and contrapositive of the conditional statement 
in the integral test.

\item On the Island of Knights and Knaves (see page~\pageref{IKK} you encounter two individuals named Locke and Demosthenes.  

Locke says, ``Demosthenes is a knave.'' \newline
Demosthenes says ``Locke and I are knights.''

Who is a knight and who a knave?

\section{Logical equivalences}
\label{sec:le}


\noindent{\large \bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}

\item There are 3 operations used in basic algebra (addition, 
multiplication and exponentiation) and thus
there are potentially 6 different distributive laws.  State
all 6 ``laws'' and determine which 2 are actually valid.
(As an example, the distributive law of addition over multiplication
would look like $x + (y \cdot z) = (x + y) \cdot (x + z)$, this isn't 
one of the true ones.) 

\item Use truth tables to verify or disprove the following 
logical equivalences.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $(A \land B) \lor B \; \cong \; (A \lor B) \land B$
\item $A \land (B \lor {\lnot}A) \; \cong \; A \land B $
\item $(A \land {\lnot}B) \lor ({\lnot}A \land {\lnot}B) \cong
(A \lor {\lnot}B) \land ({\lnot}A \lor {\lnot}B)$ 
\item The absorption laws.
\end{enumerate}

\item Draw pairs of related digital logic circuits that illustrate
DeMorgan's laws.

\item Find the negation of each of the following and simplify as much as possible.
\medskip

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $(A \lor B) \; \iff \; C$
\medskip

  \item $(A \lor B) \; \implies \; (A \land B)$

  \end{enumerate}

\item Because a conditional sentence is equivalent to a certain disjunction, and 
because DeMorgan's law tells us that the negation of a disjunction is a conjunction,
it follows that the negation of a conditional is a conjunction.  Find denials (the negation
of a sentence is often called its ``denial'') for each of the following conditionals.

\begin{enumerate}
\item ``If you smoke, you'll get lung cancer.''
\item ``If a substance glitters, it is not necessarily gold.''
\item ``If there is smoke, there must also be fire.''
\item ``If a number is squared, the result is positive.''
\item ``If a matrix is square, it is invertible.''
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\item The so-called ``ethic of reciprocity'' is an idea that has come 
up in many of the world's religions and philosophies.  
Below are statements of the ethic
from several sources.  Discuss their logical meanings and determine which (if 
any) are logically equivalent.

\begin{enumerate}
\item ``One should not behave towards others in a way which is disagreeable to oneself.'' Mencius Vii.A.4 (Hinduism)
\item ``None of you [truly] believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself.'' Number 13 of Imam ``Al-Nawawi's Forty Hadiths.'' (Islam)
\item ``And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.'' Luke 6:31, King James Version. (Christianity)
\item ``What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow man. This is the law: all the rest is commentary.'' Talmud, Shabbat 31a. (Judaism)
\item ``An it harm no one, do what thou wilt'' (Wicca)
\item ``What you would avoid suffering yourself, seek not to impose on others.'' (the Greek philosopher Epictetus -- first century A.D.)
\item ``Do not do unto others as you expect they should do unto you. Their tastes may not be the same.'' (the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw -- 20th century A.D.)
\end{enumerate}

\item You encounter two natives of the land of knights and knaves. Fill
in an explanation for each line of the proofs of their identities. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Natasha says, ``Boris is a knave.'' \\
Boris says, ``Natasha and I are knights.''\\

\textbf{Claim:} Natasha is a knight, and Boris is a knave.\\

\begin{proof} If Natasha is a knave, then Boris is a knight.\\
If Boris is a knight, then Natasha is a knight.\\
Therefore, if Natasha is a knave, then Natasha is a knight.\\
Hence Natasha is a knight.\\
Therefore, Boris is a knave.
\end{proof}

\item Bonaparte says ``I am a knight and Wellington is a knave.''\\
Wellington says ``I would tell you that B is a knight.''

\textbf{Claim:} Bonaparte and Wellington are both knaves.

\begin{proof}
If Bonaparte is a knight, then Wellington is a knight.\\
If Wellington is a knight, then Bonaparte is a knave.\\
Therefore, if Bonaparte is a knight, then Bonaparte is a knave.\\
Therefore, Bonaparte is a knave.\\
If Bonaparte is a knave, then Wellington is a knave.\\
Therefore, Wellington is a knave.
\end{proof}

\end{enumerate}

logical equivalences.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $A \lor (A \land B) \; \cong \; A \land (A \lor B)$
\medskip

\item $(A \land \lnot B) \lor A \; \cong \; A$
\medskip

\item $A \lor B \; \cong \; A \lor (\lnot A \land B)$

\section{Quantified statements}
\label{sec:quant}


\noindent{\large \bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}
\item There is a common variant of the existential quantifier,
$\exists !$, if you write $\exists ! \, x, \, P(x)$ you are asserting 
that there is a \index{unique existence}\emph{unique} element 
in the universe that makes $P(x)$ true.
Determine how to negate the sentence $\exists ! \, x, \, P(x)$.

\item The order in which quantifiers appear is important.  Let $L(x,y)$
be the open sentence ``$x$ is in love with $y$.''  Discuss the meanings of the
following quantified statements and find their negations.

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\forall x \, \exists y \; L(x,y)$.
\item $\exists x \, \forall y \; L(x, y)$.
\item $\forall x \, \forall y \; L(x, y)$.
\item $\exists x \, \exists y \; L(x, y)$.
\end{enumerate}

\item Determine a useful denial of: 

$\displaystyle \forall \epsilon>0 \, \exists 
\delta>0 \, \forall x \, (|x-c| < \delta) \implies (|f(x)-l| < \epsilon) $.

The denial above gives a criterion for saying $\lim_{x\rightarrow c}f(x) \neq l.$

\item A \index{Sophie Germain prime} \emph{Sophie Germain prime} is a prime number $p$
such that the corresponding odd number $2p+1$ is also a prime.  For example 11 is a 
Sophie Germain prime since $23 = 2\cdot 11 + 1$ is also prime.  Almost all Sophie Germain
primes are congruent to $5 \pmod{6}$, nevertheless, there are exceptions -- so the
statement ``There are Sophie Germain primes that are not 5 mod 6.'' is true.  Verify this.

\item  Alvin, Betty, and Charlie enter a cafeteria which offers three different
entrees, turkey sandwich, veggie burger, and pizza; four different
beverages, soda, water, coffee, and milk; and two types of desserts,
pie and pudding. Alvin takes a turkey sandwich, a soda, and a pie.
Betty takes a veggie burger, a soda, and a pie. Charlie takes a pizza
and a soda. Based on this information, determine whether the following
statements are true or false.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{negated}$\forall$ people $p$, $\exists$ dessert $d\backepsilon p$
took $d$.
\item \label{compare}$\exists$ person $p\backepsilon\forall$ desserts
$d$, $p$ did not take $d$.
\item $\forall$ entrees $e$, $\exists$ person $p\backepsilon p$ took
$e$. 
\item \label{entree}$\exists$ entree $e\backepsilon$ $\forall$ people
$p,\ p$ took $e$.
\item $\forall$ people $p$, $p$ took a dessert $\iff p$ did not take
a pizza.
\item Change one word of statement \ref{entree} so that it becomes true.
\item Write down the negation of \ref{negated} and compare it to statement
\ref{compare}. Hopefully you will see that they are the same! Does
this make you want to modify one or both of your answers to \ref{negated}
and \ref{compare}?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Deductive reasoning and Argument forms}
\label{sec:deduct}


\noindent{\large \bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}

\item In the movie ``Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' we encounter
a medieval villager who (with a bit of prompting) makes the 
following argument.

\begin{quote}
If she weighs the same as a duck, then she's made of wood. \newline
If she's made of wood then she's a witch. \newline
Therefore, if she weighs the same as a duck, she's a witch.
\end{quote} 

Which rule of inference is he using?

\item In constructive dilemma, the antecedent of the conditional 
sentences are usually chosen to represent opposite alternatives. 
This allows us to introduce their disjunction as a tautology. 
Consider the following proof that there is never any reason to worry
(found on the walls of an Irish pub).

\begin{quote}
Either you are sick or you are well. \newline
If you are well there's nothing to worry about. \newline
If you are sick there are just two possibilities: \newline
Either you will get better or you will die. \newline
If you are going to get better there's nothing to worry about. \newline
If you are going to die there are just two possibilities:\newline
Either you will go to Heaven or to Hell. \newline
If you go to Heaven there is nothing to worry about.
If you go to Hell, you'll be so busy shaking hands with all your friends there won't be time to worry \ldots
\end{quote}

Identify the three tautologies that are introduced in this ``proof.''

\newpage

\item For each of the following arguments, write it in symbolic form and determine 
which rules of inference are used.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \rule{0pt}{24pt} You are either with us, or you're against us.  And you don't appear to be with us.
So, that means you're against us!
\item \rule{0pt}{24pt} All those who had cars escaped the flooding.  Sandra had a car -- therefore, Sandra
escaped the flooding.
\item \rule{0pt}{24pt}  When Johnny goes to the casino, he always gambles 'til he goes broke.  Today, Johnny
has money, so Johnny hasn't been to the casino recently.
\item \rule{0pt}{24pt} (A non-constructive proof that there are 
irrational numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^b$ is rational.)  
Either $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is rational or it is irrational.
If $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is rational, we let $a=b=\sqrt{2}$.
Otherwise, we let $a=\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ and $b=\sqrt{2}$.
(Since $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}} = 2$, which is rational.) It follows that in either case, there
are irrational numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $a^b$ is rational.
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Validity of arguments and common errors}
\label{sec:valid}


\noindent{\large \bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the logical form of the following arguments.  Use symbols
to express that form and determine whether the form is valid or invalid.
If the form is invalid, determine the type of error made.  Comment on the 
soundness of the argument as well, in particular, determine whether any of
the premises are questionable.
\begin{enumerate}
\item All who are guilty are in prison. \newline
  George is not in prison.  \newline
  Therefore, George is not guilty.
\item If one eats oranges one will have high levels of vitamin C. \newline
  You do have high levels of vitamin C. \newline
  Therefore, you must eat oranges.
\item All fish live in water. \newline
  The mackerel is a fish. \newline
  Therefore, the mackerel lives in water. 
\item If you're lazy, don't take math courses.\newline
  Everyone is lazy. \newline
  Therefore, no one should take math courses.
\item All fish live in water. \newline
  The octopus lives in water. \newline
  Therefore, the octopus is a fish.
\item If a person goes into politics, they are a scoundrel.\newline
  Harold has gone into politics. \newline
  Therefore, Harold is a scoundrel. 
\end{enumerate}

\item Below is a rule of inference that we call extended elimination.

\begin{tabular}{cl}
 & $(A \lor B) \lor C$ \\
 & $\lnot A$ \\
 & $\lnot B$ \\ \hline
$\therefore$ & $C$ \\
\end{tabular}

Use a truth table to verify that this rule is valid.

\item If we allow quantifiers and open sentences in an argument form we
get arguments that are termed ``universal'' and ``particular.''

For example  \begin{tabular}{cl}
 & $\forall x, A(x) \implies B(x)$ \\
 & $A(p)$ \\ \hline
$\therefore$ & $B(p)$ \\
\end{tabular}  is the particular form of modus ponens (here, $p$
is not a variable -- it stands for some particular element of the universe of
discourse)
and \begin{tabular}{cl}
 & $\forall x, A(x) \implies B(x)$ \\
 & $\forall x, \lnot B(x)$ \\ \hline
$\therefore$ & $\forall x, \lnot A(x)$ \\
\end{tabular} is the universal form of modus tollens.

Reexamine the arguments from problem (1), determine their forms
(including quantifiers) and whether they are universal or particular.

\item Identify the rule of inference being used.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Buley Library is very tall.\\
Therefore, either the Buley Library is very tall or it has many
levels underground.

\item The grass is green.\\
The sky is blue.\\
Therefore, the grass is green and the sky is blue.

\item $g$ has order 3 or it has order 4.\\
If $g$ has order 3, then $g$ has an inverse.\\
If $g$ has order 4, then $g$ has an inverse.\\
Therefore, $g$ has an inverse.

\item $x$ is greater than 5 and $x$ is less than 53.\\
Therefore, $x$ is less than 53.

\item If $a|b$, then $a$ is a perfect square.\\
If $a|b$, then $b$ is a perfect square.\\
Therefore, if $a|b$, then $a$ is a perfect square and $b$ is
a perfect square.

\end{enumerate}

\item Read the following proof that the sum of two odd numbers is even.
Discuss the rules of inference used.\\
\begin{proof}
Let $x$ and $y$ be odd numbers. Then $x=2k+1$
and $y=2j+1$ for some integers $j$ and $k$. By algebra,
\[
x+y = 2k+1 + 2j+1 = 2(k+j+1).
\]

Note that $k+j+1$ is an integer because $k$ and $j$ are integers.
Hence $x+y$ is even. 
\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
