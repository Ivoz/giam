\begin{enumerate}
\item Every prime number greater than 3 is of one of the two forms
$6k+1$ or $6k+5$.  What statement(s) could be used as hypotheses in
proving this theorem?

\item Prove that 129 is odd.

\item Prove that the sum of two rational numbers is a rational number.

\item Prove that the sum of an odd number and an even number is odd.

\item Prove that if the sum of two integers is even, then so is their
difference.

\item Prove that for every real number $x$, $\frac{2}{3} < x < \frac{3}{4} \; \implies \; \lfloor 12x \rfloor = 8$.

\item Prove that if $x$ is an odd integer, then $x^2$ is of the form
$4k+1$ for some integer $k$.

\item Prove that for all integers $a$ and $b$, if $a$ is odd and $6 \divides (a+b)$, then $b$ is odd.

\item Prove that $\forall x\in\mathbb{R},\ x\not\in\mathbb{Z}\implies\lfloor x\rfloor+\lfloor-x\rfloor=-1$.

\item Define the \index{evenness}\emph{evenness} of an integer $n$ by:

\[ \mbox{evenness} (n) = k \; \iff \;  
 2^k \divides n \, \land \, 2^{k+1} \nmid n \]

State and prove a theorem concerning the evenness of products.


\item Suppose that $a$, $b$ and $c$ are integers such that $a \divides b$
and $b \divides c$.  Prove that $a \divides c$.

\item Suppose that $a$, $b$, $c$ and $d$ are integers with $a \neq c$.
Further, suppose that $x$ is a real number satisfying the equation

\[ \frac{ax+b}{cx+d} = 1. \]

\noindent Show that $x$ is rational.  Where is the hypothesis $a \neq c$
used?

\item Show that if two positive integers $a$ and $b$ satisfy $a \divides b$ \emph{and}
$b \divides a$ then they are equal.
