The Makefile in this directory will create both a Beamer slide deck and a "handouts" version.

Use
 	make filename.pdf

to get the standard slides, and

	make filename-handouts.pdf 

to get the handouts version.

There is also a rule for processing "LaTeX + PDF" figures.  Use

	make figure_filename.tex
	
to get both the .tex and the .pdf.  This presumes the existance of figure_filename.fig in this directory.
