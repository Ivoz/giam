\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the power set of $\emptyset$?  Hint: if you got the last exercise
in the chapter you'd know that this power set has $2^0 = 1$ element.

\item Try iterating the power set operator.  What is ${\mathcal P}({\mathcal P}(\emptyset))$?  What is ${\mathcal P}({\mathcal P}({\mathcal P}(\emptyset)))$?

\item Determine the following cardinalities.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $A = \{ 1, 2, \{3, 4, 5\}\} \quad |A| = $\rule{36pt}{1pt}
    \item $B = \{ \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \} \quad |B| = $\rule{36pt}{1pt}  
  \end{enumerate}

\item What, in Logic, corresponds the notion $\emptyset$ in Set theory?

\item What, in Set theory, corresponds to the notion $t$ (a tautology) in Logic?

\item What is the truth set of the proposition $P(x) = $ ``3 divides $x$ and 2 divides $x$''?

\item Find a logical open sentence such that $\{0, 1, 4, 9, \ldots \}$ is
its truth set.

\item How many singleton sets are there in the power set of 
$\{a,b,c,d,e\}$?  ``Doubleton'' sets?

\item How many 8 element subsets are there in
${\mathcal P}(\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p\})$?

\item How many singleton sets are there in the power set of 
$\{1,2,3, \ldots n\}$?
