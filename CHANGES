Version 2.0  (9/2010) Initial version released with hardcopy also available through Lulu.com.
  A huge number of typos were corrected and many new exercises added.

Version 2.1  (5/2012) 
  Page xviii "Principle" -> "Principal"
  Page 361  Fixed mangled equation near bottom of page. 
  Put exercises into seperate files
  In Section 2.3 exercise 7 part b: proof was entirely wrong.
  Exercise #9 in Section 3.3 the hypotheses should have included that the
real numbers a,b,c and d are positive.
  Exercise #7 in Section 3.5 The correct number of integers in [1,100] that
can't be written using fewer than 4 squares is 15 (not 17).
  Exercise #9 in Section 5.3 The statement had a typo, the correct statement
to prove is 6|(2n^3 - 2n - 12).

Version 3.0 (12/2012)
  Dealt with the whole "Is 0 in the Naturals?" issue.
  Fixed many typographical errors.
  Reformatted to allow for creating a workbook for exercises.
  Fixed errors in several exercises:
    Exercise #7 (part b) in Section 2.3.
    Exercise #9 in Section 3.3.
    Exercise #7 in Section 3.5.
    Exercise #9 in Section 5.3. 

Notes for 3.1:

Exercise: Show that $(A \cap B) \cup C \neq A \cap (B \cup C)$.  I.e. the associative 
law doesn't work if two different operators are involved.

Exercise: The distributive laws of $\cap$ over $\cap$ and $\cup$ over $\cup$ aren't invalid
but they are redundant...  Show that $A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup (A \cup C)$ can be
derived using other rules.

Check the section on induction regarding the quantification status of P(k) in proving P(k)=>P(k+1)

Add double negation laws (resp. double complementation) to Logic and Set Theory sections (esp. the 
tables summarizing the rules).

Need a discussion on which axioms are acceptable for use in our first "proofs" chapter.


Karl Crisman's email:

  Dear Joe,

  Thanks for your book - I appreciate it!  You never know if it might be appropriate for 
  our Transition course... and it looks fun :)

  And while perusing it I already found several typos, which of course is par for the course without
  huge companies at your back, or probably is also par for the course then - 10000 words make for a
  heavy time editing :(  But I hope these below will help.  I need to get back to class prep but
  reading this is more interesting :)

  Have a great semester,
  Karl-Dieter

  Page xix, line 4:
    Is it "advisor" or "adviser"?  I usually use "advisor", but maybe I'm mistaken...
(Wiktionary claims the er form is more prevalent, but either is correct -- JEF)

  Page xix, toward the bottom:
    If I'm not mistaken, Deborah Hughes-Hallett is one person.

  Page 1, footnote:
    Probably "shuf" is "schuf".  I haven't seen the Kronecker quote in German before, though, so it
  could be some now-antiquated spelling.

  Page 2, toward the bottom:
    The integers are ... with a $\mathbb{Z}$ because of the German word \emph{zahlen} which means
   ``to count.''
    Either you need to change it to "Zahlen" (cap) which means "numbers" or to "z√§hlen" (with
  umlaut); "zahlen" means to pay.
