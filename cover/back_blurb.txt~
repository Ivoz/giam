At many universities and colleges in the United States 
a course which provides a transition from lower-level 
mathematics courses to those in the major has been 
adopted.  Courses for Math majors, and especially those 
one takes in the Junior and Senior years, focus on proofs;
students are expected to learn why a given statement is 
true, and be able to come up with their own convincing 
arguments concerning such "why"s.   Mathematics courses 
that precede these typically focus on "how."  How does 
one find the minimum value a continuous function takes 
on an interval?  How does one determine the arclength 
along some curve.  Et cetera.  The essential raison d'etre
of this text and others like it is to ease this transition 
from "how" courses to "why" courses.  In other words, our 
purpose is to help students develop a certain facility 
with mathematical proof.

This text aims at developing this facility with proof
while, at the same time, exposing the reader to some of 
the "culture" of mathematics.  Also, there are amusing 
quotations at the start of every chapter.
