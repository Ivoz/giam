A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Mathematics (GIAM for short) is a textbook for a "transitions" course.

Transitions courses (also known as "foundations" or "intro to proofs" courses) are typically taken after the Calculus sequence and before upper-division coursework in the mathematics major.  Their purpose is to acclimatize the student to some of the culture and terminology of mathematics and to begin developing in them a proficiency at reading and writing mathematical proofs.  

GIAM has chapters on Logic, Set theory, Relations and Cardinality interspersed with chapters on proofs -- direct and indirect arguments, induction, combinatorial reasoning and "magic". 

This is version 3.1SN.  
The 'S' flag indicates that the symbol used for logical negation is ~. 
The 'N' flag indicates that the convention that 1 (not 0) is the smallest natural number is maintained throughout.
