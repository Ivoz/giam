Notes on Len Brin's notes on GIAM

from giam.okular:

pg 144 "Well let's see one."
  ???

pg 146 (exercises for 3.1) problem 4, k is unquantified.
       problem 5 (about evenness)
      LB -- "I'm not sure how to do this without the use of contradiction at some level. The definition is very tricky to work with otherwise."

pg 150 (exercises for 3.2) problem 2 about the quadratic formula was mangled.
fixed.

pg 157 comment on chapter title: "Shouldn't this be just "Disproofs". Granted you discuss disproofs of universal statements, but your main premise seems to be that the proper way to prove ANY statement is to prove its negation."

I suppose that should read "...disprove ANY statement..."

I somehow don't agree, but am making change anyway.

pg 168 (exercise 3) "what cases?"
  indeed!

pg 170 the root2^root2^root2 problem lacked parentheses
  fixed.

pg 173 redundant parenthesis
  must have been fixed previously...

pg 184 LB: "Nowhere have you discussed the symbol for superset. Was 
that intentional?"
  added a sentence correcting the omission

From giamLaptop.okular:

pg 106 & 107 comma splices
  fixed

pg 113 three comma splices
  fixed 2 out of 3.

pg 119 comma splice
  replaced w/ em-dash

pg 179 The following was circled: 
"The membership question: MA (x) = “Is x in the set A?” Or, more
succinctly, MA (x) = “x ∈ A”. Thus the atomic concept “true” from Logic
corresponds to the answer “yes” to the membership question in Set theory
(and of course “false” corresponds to “no”)."

and commented:
"This is a circular "definition" of a set."

me no get it...

pg 181 a quibble
  ignored

pg 194 LB: "relative or symmetric?"
  relative

pg 195 issue regarding the exercise that uses sets of playing cards
  I think it's ok as is...

pg 211 LB identifies this page as the place where we begin
treating 0 as a natural number.

pg 214 a quibble

pg 215 question regarding when the absolute value notation for the
cardinality of a set was introduced (it never was)
  added something at the end of section 4.1
