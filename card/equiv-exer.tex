\begin{enumerate}
\item Name four sets in the equivalence class of $\{1, 2, 3\}$.

\wbitemsep

\item Prove that set equivalence is an equivalence relation.

\item Construct a Venn diagram showing the relationships between the sets of
sets which are finite, infinite, countable, denumerable and uncountable.

\wbvfill

\item Place the sets $\Naturals$, $\Reals$, $\Rationals$, $\Integers$, $\Integers \times \Integers$, $\Complexes$, $\Naturals_{2007}$ and $\emptyset$; 
somewhere on the Venn diagram above. (Note to students (and graders): 
there are no wrong answers to this question, the point is to see what 
your intuition about these sets says at this point.)
