\item How could the clerk at the Hilbert Hotel accommodate a countable
number of new guests?

\item Let $F$ be the collection of all real-valued functions 
defined on the real line.  Find an injection from $\Reals$ to $F$.  Do you 
think it is possible to find an injection going the other way?  In 
other words, do you think that $F$ and $\Reals$ are equivalent?  Explain.

\item Fill in the details of the proof that dominance is an ordering relation.
(You may simply cite the C-B-S theorem in proving anti-symmetry.)

\wbvfill

\item We can inject $\Rationals$ into $\Integers$ by sending 
$\displaystyle \pm \frac{a}{b}$ to $\displaystyle \pm 2^a3^b$.  
 Use this and another obvious injection to (in light of the C-B-S 
theorem) reaffirm the equivalence of these sets.
