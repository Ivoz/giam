    In every branch of Mathematics there are special, <index><main>atomic concepts</main></index>
    atomic, notions that
    defy precise definition. In Geometry, for example, the atomic notions
    are points, lines and their incidence. Euclid defines a point as
    <q>that which has no part</q> <mdash /> people can argue (and have argued) incessantly
    over what exactly is meant by this. Is it essentially saying that anything
    without volume, area or length of some sort is a point? In modern times
    it has been recognized that any formal system of argumentation has to
    have such elemental, undefined, concepts <mdash /> and that Euclid's apparent
    lapse in precision comes from an attempt to hide this basic fact.
    The notion of <q>point</q> can't really <em>be</em> defined. All we can do
    is point (no joke intended) at a variety of points and hope that our
    audience will absorb the same concept of point that we hold via the
    process of <index><main>induction</main></index>induction<fn>inference of a 
    generalized conclusion from particular instances <mdash /> compare DEDUCTION</fn>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The atomic concepts in Set Theory are <q>set</q>, <q>element</q> and <q>membership</q>.
    The atomic concepts in Logic are <q>true</q>, <q>false</q>, <index><main>sentence</main></index>
    <q>sentence</q> and <index><main>statement</main></index> <q>statement</q>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Regarding <em>true</em> and <em>false</em>, we hope there is no uncertainty
    as to their meanings. <em>Sentence</em> also has a well-understood
    meaning that most will agree on <mdash /> a syntactically correct ordered collection
    of words such as <q>Johnny was a football player.</q> or <q>Red is a color.</q>
    or <q>This is a sentence which does not refer to itself.</q> A <em>statement</em>
    is a sentence which is either true or false.
    In other words, a statement
    is a sentence whose truth value is <em>definite</em>, in more other words,
    it is always possible to decide <mdash /> one way or the other <mdash /> whether
    a statement is true or false.<fn>Although, as a practical matter
    it may be almost impossibly difficult to do so!  For instance it is 
    certainly either true or false that I ate eggs for breakfast on my 21st
    birthday <mdash /> but I don't remember, and short of building a time machine,
    I don't know how you could find out.</fn> The first example
    of a sentence given above (<q>Johnny was a football player</q>) is not a
    statement <mdash /> the problem is that it is ambiguous unless we know who
    Johnny is. If it had said <q>Johnny Unitas was a football player.</q> then
    it would have been a statement. If it had said <q>Johnny Appleseed was a
    football player.</q> it would also have been a statement, just not a true one.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ambiguity is only one reason that a sentence may not be a statement. As
    we consider more complex sentences, it may be the case that the truth
    value of a given sentence simply cannot be decided. One of the most
    celebrated mathematical results of the 20th century is
    <index><main>G&#xf6;del, Kurt</main></index>Kurt G&#xf6;del's
    <index><main>Incompleteness Theorem</main></index><q>Incompleteness Theorem.</q>
    An important aspect of this theory is
    the proof that in any axiomatic system of mathematical thought
    there must be undecidable sentences <mdash /> statements which can neither be proved
    nor disproved from the axioms<fn>There are trivial systems that 
    are complete, but if a system is sufficiently complicated that it contains 
    <q>interesting</q> statements it can't be complete.</fn>.
    Simple sentences (e.g. those of the form
    subject-verb-object) have little chance of being undecidable for this
    reason, so we will next look at ways of building more complex sentences
    from simple components.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's start with an example. Suppose I come up to you in some windowless
    room and make the statement: <q>The sun is shining but it's raining!</q>
    You decide to investigate my claim and determine its veracity. Upon
    reaching a room that has a view of the exterior there are four possible
    combinations of sunniness and/or precipitation that you may find. That is,
    the atomic predicates <q>The sun is shining</q> and <q>It is raining</q> can each
    be true or false independently of one another. In the following table
    we introduce a convention used throughout the remainder of this book <mdash /> that true is indicated with a capital letter T and false is indicated
    with the Greek letter <m>\phi</m> (which is basically a Greek F, and is a lot harder
    to mistake for a T than an F is.)
  </p>
  <tabular>
    <row>
      <cell>The sun is shining</cell>
      <cell>It is raining</cell>
    </row>
    <row bottom="minor">
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell>T</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>T</cell>
      <cell><m>\phi</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell><m>\phi</m></cell>
      <cell>T</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell><m>\phi</m></cell>
      <cell><m>\phi</m></cell>
    </row>
  </tabular>
  <p>
    Each row of the above table represents a possible state of the outside
    world. Suppose you observe the conditions given in the last row, namely
    that it is neither sunny, nor is it raining <mdash /> you would certainly conclude
    that I am not to be trusted. I.e. my statement, the compounding of
    <q>The sun is shining</q> and <q>It is raining</q> (with the word <q>but</q> in between
    as a connector) is false. If you think about it a bit, you'll agree that
    this so-called <index><main>compound sentence</main></index><em>compound sentence</em> is true
    only in the case that both
    of its component pieces are true. This underscores an amusing linguistic
    point: <q>but</q> and <q>and</q> have exactly the same meaning! More precisely,
    they <em>denote</em> the same thing, they have subtly different connotations
    however <mdash /> <q>but</q> indicates that both of the statements it connects
    are true and that the speaker is surprised by this state of affairs.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Mathematics we distinguish two main connectives for hooking-up simple
    sentences into compound ones. The <index><main>conjunction</main></index><em>conjunction</em>
    of two sentences is
    the compound sentence made by sticking the word <q>and</q> between them.
    The <index><main>disjunction</main></index><em>disjunction</em> of two sentences is
    formed by placing an <q>or</q>
    between them. Conjunctions are true only when both components are true.
    Disjunctions are false only when both components are false.
  </p>

  <p>
    As usual, mathematicians have developed an incredibly terse, compact
    notation for these ideas.<fn>One begins to suspect that 
    mathematicians form an unusually lazy sub-species of humanity.</fn>
    First, we represent an
    entire sentence by a single letter <mdash /> traditionally, a capital letter.
    This is called a <index><main>predicate variable</main></index><em>predicate variable</em>.
    For example, following the example above, we could denote the sentence
    <q>The sun is shining</q> by the letter <m>S</m>. Similarly, we could make the
    assignment <m>R =</m> <q>It is raining.</q> The conjunction and disjunction
    of these sentences can then be represented using the symbols <m>S \land R</m>
    and <m>S \lor R</m>, respectively. As a mnemonic, note that the connective
    in <m>S \land R</m> looks very much like the capital letter A (as in And).
  </p>

  <p>
    To display, very succinctly, the effect of these two connectives we can
    use so-called <index><main>truth table</main></index>truth tables. In a truth table we list
    all possible truth
    values of the predicate variables and then enumerate the truth values
    of some compound sentence. For the conjunction and disjunction
    connectors we have (respectively):
  </p>
  <tabular>
    <row>
      <cell><m>A</m></cell>
      <cell><m>B</m></cell>
      <cell><m>A \land B</m></cell>

      <cell><m>\phi</m></cell>

    </row>
  </tabular>
  and
  <tabular>
    <row>
      <cell><m>A</m></cell>
      <cell><m>B</m></cell>
      <cell><m>A \lor B</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row bottom="minor">
      <cell></cell>

      <cell><m>\phi</m></cell>
      <cell><m>\phi</m></cell>
    </row>
  </tabular>
  .

  <p>
    In addition to these connectors we need a modifier (called
    <index><main>negation</main></index><em>negation</em>)
    that acts on individual sentences. The negation of a sentence <m>A</m> is
    denoted by <m>{\lnot}A</m>, and its truth value is exactly the opposite of
    <m>A</m>'s truth value. The negation of a sentence is also known as the
    <em>denial</em> of a sentence.
    A truth table for the negation operator is somewhat
    trivial but we include it here for completeness.
  </p>
  <tabular>
    <row>
      <cell><m>A</m></cell>
      <cell><m>{\lnot}A</m></cell>

    These three simple tools (and, or <ampersand /> not) are sufficient to
    create extraordinarily complex sentences out of basic components.
    The way these pieces interrelate is a bit reminiscent of algebra,
    in fact the study of these logical operators (or any
    operators that act like them) is called <index><main>Boole, George</main></index>
    <em>Boolean Algebra</em><fn>In honor of George Boole, whose 1854 
     book <em>An investigation into the Laws of Thought</em> inaugurated the 
     subject.</fn>. There are distinct differences
    between Boolean and ordinary algebra however. In regular algebra we have
    the binary connectors <m>+</m> (plus) and <m>\cdot</m> (times), and the unary
    negation operator <m>-</m>, these are certainly analogous to <m>\land</m>, <m>\lor</m> <ampersand />
    <m>\lnot</m>, but there are certain consequences of the fact that multiplication
    is effectively repeated addition that simply don't hold for the Boolean
    operators. For example, there is a well-defined precedence between <m>\cdot</m> and
    <m>+</m>. In parsing the expression <m>4 \cdot 5 + 3</m> we all know that the
    multiplication is to be done first. There is no such rule governing
    order of operations between <m>\land</m> and <m>\lor</m>, so an expression like
    <m>A \land B \lor C</m> is simply ambiguous <mdash /> it <em>must</em> have parentheses
    inserted in order to show the order, either <m>(A \land B) \lor C</m> or
    <m>A \land (B \lor C)</m>. Another distinction between ordinary and Boolean
    algebra is exponentiation. If there <em>were</em> exponents in Boolean algebra,
    we'd need two different kinds <mdash /> one for repeated conjunction and another
    for repeated disjunction.
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Why is it that there is no such thing as exponentiation
        in the algebra of Logic?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    While there are many differences between Boolean algebra and the
    usual, garden-variety algebra, there are also many similarities.
    For instance, the <index><main>associative law</main></index>associative,
    <index><main>commutative law</main></index>commutative and
    <index><main>distributive law</main></index>distributive laws
    of Algebra all have versions that work in the Boolean case.
  </p>

  <p>
    A very handy way of visualizing Boolean expressions is given by
    digital logic circuit diagrams. To discuss these diagrams we
    must make a brief digression into Electronics. One of the most
    basic components inside an electronic device is a <index><main>transistor</main></index>
    transistor,
    this is a component that acts like a switch for electricity,
    but the switch itself is controlled by electricity. In <xref ref="fig_trans">Figure</xref>
    we see the usual schematic representation of a transistor. If voltage
    is applied to the wire labeled z, the transistor becomes conductive,
    and current may flow from x to y.

    Suppose that two transistors are connected as in <xref ref="fig_series">Figure</xref>
    (this is called a <index><main>series connection</main></index><em>series</em> connection).
    In order for current to flow
    from x to y we must have voltage applied to <em>both</em> the wires labeled
    z and w. In other words, this circuit effectively creates the <em>and</em>
    operation <mdash /> assuming voltage is always applied to x, if z <em>and</em> w
    are energized then the output at y will be energized.

  <p>
    When two transistors are connected in <index><main>parallel connection</main></index>parallel (this is illustrated in
    <xref ref="fig_par">Figure</xref>) current can flow from x to y when either (or <em>both</em>)
    of the wires at z and w have voltage applied. This brings up a point
    which is confusing for some: in common speech the use of the word <q>or</q> often
    has the sense known as <index><main>exclusive or</main></index><em>exclusive or</em> (a.k.a. xor), when we say <q>X or Y</q>
    we mean <q>Either X or Y, but not both.</q> In Electronics and Mathematics,
    <em>or</em> always has the non-exclusive (better known as
    <index><main>inclusive or</main></index>inclusive) sense.

    An and-gate has two transistors inside it that are wired in series <mdash /> if both the inputs are energized the output will be too. An
    or-gate has two transistors in parallel inside it. Not-gates

    Using this graphical <q>language</q> one can make schematic
    representations of logical expressions. Some find that
    tracing such diagrams makes understanding the structure
    of a Boolean expression easier. For example, in <xref ref="fig_3ands">Figure</xref>
    we illustrate 2 of the possible ways that the conjunction
    of four predicate variables can be parenthesized. In fact, when
    a multitude of predicates are joined by the same connective,
    the way in which the expression is parenthesized is unimportant,
    thus one often sees a further shorthand <mdash /> gates with more than
    2 inputs.

    A common task for an electronics designer is to come up with
    a digital logic circuit having a prescribed input/output table.
    Note that an input/output table for a logic circuit is entirely
    analogous with a truth table for a compound sentence in Logic <mdash />
    except that we use 0's and 1's rather than T's and <m>\phi</m>'s.

    A systematic method for accomplishing such a design task involves
    a notion called <index><main>disjunctive normal form</main></index><em>disjunctive normal form</em>.
    A Boolean expression
    is in disjunctive normal form if it consists of the disjunction of
    one or more statements, each of which consists entirely of conjunctions
    of predicate variables and/or their negations. In other words, the <em>or</em>
    of a bunch of <em>ands</em>. In terms of digital logic circuits, the <em>and</em>s
    we're talking about are called <index><main>recognizers</main></index><em>recognizers</em>.
    For example,
    the following 3-input and-gates recognize the input states in
    the 4th, 7th and 8th rows of the i/o table above. (These are the rows
    where the output is supposed to be 1.)

          Design a digital logic circuit (using and, or <ampersand /> not gates) that 
          implements an exclusive or.



          \hint{First, it's essential to know what is meant by the term "exclusive or". This is the interpretation that many people give to the word "or" <mdash /> where "X or Y" means either X is true or Y is true, but that it isn't the case that both X and Y are true. This (wrong) understanding of what "or" means is common because it is often the case that X and Y represent complimentary possibilities: old or new, cold or hot, right or wrong... The truth table for exclusive or (often written xor, pronounced "ex-or", symbolically it is usually <m>\oplus</m>) is

          So it's true when one, or the other, but not both of its inputs are true.  The upshot of the last sentence is that we can write <m>X \oplus Y \; \equiv \; (X \lor Y) \land {\lnot}(X \land Y)</m>.

          Consider the sentence 
          <q>This is a sentence which does not refer to itself.</q>
          which was given in the beginning of this chapter as an example.
          Is this sentence a statement?  If so, what is its truth value?

          \hint{The only question in your mind, when deciding whether a sentence is a statement, should be "Does this thing have a definite truth value?"
          Well?

          Isn't it just plainly false?}

      <li><p>
          Consider the sentence <q>This sentence is false.</q>  Is this 
          sentence a statement?

          Complete truth tables for each of the sentences 
          <m>(A \land B) \lor C</m> and

          the same logical content?

          A tiny hint here: since the sentences involve 3 variables you'll need truth tables with 8 rows. Here's a template.

          In the most famous knight/knave puzzle, you are in a room which has only two exits.  One leads to certain death and the other to freedom.  There are two 
          individuals in the room, and you know that one of them is a knight and the other is a knave, but you don't know which.   Your challenge is to determine the door which leads to freedom by asking a single question.
