  <title>Venn diagrams</title>
  <p>
    Hopefully, you've seen
    <index><main>Venn diagram</main></index>Venn diagrams before, but possibly
    you haven't thought deeply about them. Venn diagrams take
    advantage of an obvious but important property of closed
    curves drawn in the plane. They divide the points in the
    plane into two sets, those that are inside the curve and
    those that are outside! (Forget for a moment about the points
    that are on the curve.) This seemingly obvious statement
    is known as the
    <index><main>Jordan curve theorem</main></index><em>Jordan curve theorem</em>, and actually
    requires some details. A
    <index><main>Jordan curve</main></index><em>Jordan curve</em> is the sort
    of curve you might draw if you are required to end where
    you began and you are required not to cross-over any portion
    of the curve that has already been drawn. In technical
    terms such a curve is called <em>continuous</em>, <em>simple</em>
    and <em>closed</em>.
    The Jordan curve theorem is one of those statements that hardly
    seems like it needs a proof, but nevertheless, the proof of this
    statement is probably the best-remembered work of the famous
    French mathematician <index><main>Jordan, Camille</main></index>Camille Jordan.

    The prototypical Venn diagram is the picture that looks something
    like the view through a set of binoculars.

    In a Venn diagram the
    <index><main>universe of discourse</main></index>universe of discourse is normally drawn as
    a rectangular region inside of which all the action occurs. Each
    set in a Venn diagram is depicted by drawing a simple closed curve <mdash /> typically a circle, but not necessarily! For instance, if you
    want to draw a Venn diagram that shows all the possible intersections
    among four sets, you'll find it's impossible with (only) circles.

        intersections of 4 sets.

    There is a certain <q>zen</q> to Venn diagrams that must be internalized,
    but once you have done so they can be used to think very effectively
    about the relationships between sets. The main deal is that the points
    inside of one of the simple closed curves are not necessarily in the set <mdash /> only <em>some</em> of the points inside a simple closed curve are in the
    set, and we don't know precisely where they are! The various simple closed
    curves in a Venn diagram divide the universe up into a bunch of regions.
    It might be best to think of these regions as fenced-in areas in which
    the elements of a set mill about, much like domesticated animals
    in their pens.
    One of our main tools in working with Venn diagrams is to deduce that
    certain of these regions don't contain any elements <mdash /> we then mark that
    region with the emptyset symbol (<m>\emptyset</m>).

    This picture might lead us to think that the set of cartoon characters
    and the set of horses are disjoint, so we thought it would be nice
    to add one more element to our universe in order to dispel that notion.

    Suppose we have two sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> and we're interested
    in proving that <m>B \subseteq A</m>. The job is done if we can show that
    all of <m>B</m>'s elements are actually in the eye-shaped region that represents
    the intersection <m>A \cap B</m>. It's equivalent if we can show that the
    region marked with <m>\emptyset</m> in the following diagram is actually empty.

    Let's put all this together. The inclusion <m>B \subseteq A</m> corresponds
    to the logical sentence <m>M_B \implies M_A</m>. We know that implications
    are equivalent to OR statements, so <m>M_B \implies M_A \, \cong \, 
    {\lnot}M_B \lor M_A</m>. The notion that the region we've
    indicated above is empty is written as <m>\overline{A} \cap B \, = \, \emptyset</m>,
    in logical terms this is <m>{\lnot}M_A \land M_B \, \cong \, c</m>.
    Finally, we apply DeMorgan's law and a commutation to get
    <m>{\lnot}M_B \lor M_A \, \cong \, t</m>. You should take note of the
    convention that when you see a logical sentence just written on the
    page (as is the case with <m>M_B \implies M_A</m> in the first sentence
    of this paragraph) what's being asserted is that the sentence is
    <em>universally true</em>.
    Thus, writing <m>M_B \implies M_A</m> is the same thing as writing
    <m>M_B \implies M_A \, \cong \, t</m>.

    One can use information that is known <em>a priori</em> when
    drawing a Venn diagram. For instance if two sets are known
    to be disjoint, or if one is known to be contained in the other,
    we can draw Venn diagrams like the following.

    However, both of these situations can also be dealt with
    by working with Venn diagrams in which the sets are in
    <index><main>general position</main></index> <em>general position</em> <mdash /> which
    in this situation means that every possible intersection is
    shown <mdash /> and then marking any empty regions with <m>\emptyset</m>.

    There is a connection, perhaps obvious, between the regions we
    see in a Venn diagram with sets in general position and the recognizers
    we studied in the section on digital logic circuits. In fact both
    of these topics have to do with <index><main>disjunctive normal form</main></index><em>disjunctive normal form</em>. In a Venn diagram with <m>k</m> sets, we are seeing the universe
    of discourse broken up into the union of <m>2^k</m> regions each of which
    corresponds to an intersection of either one of the sets or its complement.
    An arbitrary expression involving set-theoretic symbols and these <m>k</m> sets
    is true in certain of these <m>2^k</m> regions and false in the others.
    We have put the arbitrary expression in disjunctive normal form when
    we express it as a union of the intersections that describe those regions.

          Venn diagrams are usually made using simple closed curves 
          with no further restrictions.  Try creating Venn diagrams for 3, 4 and
          5 sets (in general position) using rectangular simple closed curves.

          \hint{I found it easier to experiment by making my drawings on graph paper.  I never did  
          manage to draw the <m>5</m> set Venn diagram with just rectangles<ellipsis /> probably just a lack of persistence.}

          We call a curve <em>rectilinear</em> if it is made
          of line segments that meet at right angles.  If you have ever
          played with an Etch-a-Sketch you'll know what we mean by the term 
          <q>rectilinear.</q>  The following example of a rectilinear curve may
          also help to clarify this notion.

          \
          <image width="73%" source="images/rectilinear.png" />
          Use rectilinear
          simple closed curves to create a Venn diagram for 5 sets.

          \hint{Of course, rectangles are rectilinear, so one could use the solution from the previous
          problem (if, unlike me, you were persistant enough to find it).  Otherwise, 
          start with the <m>4</m> set diagram made with rectangles and use your <m>5</m>th (rectilinear) curve to split
          each region into <m>2</m> <mdash /> don't forget to split the region on the outside too.}

      <li><p>
          Argue as to why rectilinear curves will suffice to build
          any Venn diagram.

          \hint{Fortunately the instructions don't say to <em>prove</em> that rectilinear curves will always
          suffice, so we can be less rigorous.  Try to argue as to why it will alway be possible to add one more rectilinear curve to an existing Venn diagram and split every region into two.

          One might also argue that any continuous curve can be approximated using rectilinear curves.  So if a Venn diagram can be constructed using continuous curves we can also get the job done with rectilinear curves.}

          The prototypes for the <em>modus ponens</em> and <em>modus tollens</em>
          argument forms are the following:

            <row>
              <cell>\begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}All men are mortal.  
              Socrates is a man. 
              Therefore Socrates is mortal.</cell>
              <cell>and</cell>
              <cell>\begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}All men are mortal.  
              Zeus is not mortal. 
              Therefore Zeus is not a man.</cell>
            </row>
          </tabular>
          Illustrate these arguments using Venn diagrams.

          \hint{The statement <q>All men are mortal</q> would be interpreted on a Venn diagram by showing the
          set of <q>All men</q> as being entirely contained within the set of <q>mortal beings.</q>   Socrates is an 
          element of the inner set.  Zeus, on the other hand, lies outside of the outer set.}

          Now prove it!

          \hint{After constructing Venn diagrams for both sets you should be able to see that there
