\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the relation $\relS$ defined by 
$ \relS = \{ (x,y) \suchthat \; x \, \mbox{is smarter than} \, y \}$.
Is $\relS$ symmetric or anti-symmetric?  Explain.

\item Consider the relation $\relA$ defined by 
$ \relA = \{ (x,y) \suchthat \; x \, \mbox{has the same astrological sign as} \, y \}$.
Is $\relA$ symmetric or anti-symmetric?  Explain.

\item Explain why both of the relations just described (in problems 1 and 2)
have the transitive property.

\wbvfill

\item For each of the five properties, name a relation that has it
and a relation that doesn't.
