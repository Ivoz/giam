\begin{enumerate}

\item To describe a vector field in 2-d we must specify two functions that each have two inputs.  Try to get a sense of what the vector field $F=\langle f(x,y), g(x,y) \rangle$ looks like by plotting scaled down vectors at each of the grid points (points with integer coordinates) with $-2 \leq x \leq 2$ and $-2 \leq y \leq 2$ where $f(x,y) = x+y$ and $g(x,y) = x-y$.


\vfill

\item Try to guess what the component functions are for the following vector field.

\newpage

\item One way to get a vector field is to start with a function $f(x,y)$ and determine its gradient.  The gradient is a vector field whose components are $f_x$ and $f_y$.  What scalar function has the vector field $\langle 2x, 2y \rangle$ as its gradient?

\vfill

\item Give an example of a vector field that is not the gradient of any scalar function.

\vfill

\item There is a collection of curves that is known as the ``streamlines'' for any vector field.  They are curves that always follow in the direction of the arrows.  Draw several of the streamlines for the following vector field.

\newpage

\item The vector field in the previous question was the gradient of $f(x,y) = x^2 - y^2$.  Below is a contour plot for $f(x,y)$.  Conjecture how the streamlines of the gradient are related to the contours of the function.
