\begin{enumerate}

\item Design a digital logic circuit (using and, or \& not gates) that 
implements an exclusive or.

\vspace{2in}

\item Consider the sentence 
``This is a sentence which does not refer to itself.''
which was given in the beginning of this chapter as an example.
Is this sentence a statement?  If so, what is its truth value?

\vspace{.5in}

\item Consider the sentence ``This sentence is false.''  Is this 
sentence a statement?

\vspace{.5in}

\item Complete truth tables for each of the sentences 
$(A \land B) \lor C$ and
$A \land (B \lor C)$.  Does it seem that these sentences have
the same logical content?

\newpage

\item \label{ex:nand_nor} There are two other logical connectives that are
used somewhat less commonly than $\lor$ and $\land$.
These are the \index{Scheffer stroke} Scheffer stroke and the 
\index{Peirce arrow}Peirce arrow
-- written $\vert$ and $\downarrow$, respectively ---  they are 
also known as \index{NAND} NAND and \index{NOR} NOR.

\noindent The truth tables for these connectives are:
\medskip

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
$A$ & $B$ & $A \,\vert\, B$ \\ \hline
T & T & $\phi$ \\
T & $\phi$ & T \\
$\phi$ & T & T \\
$\phi$ & $\phi$ & T 
\end{tabular}
\hspace{.25 in} and \hspace{.25 in}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
$A$ & $B$ & $A \downarrow B$ \\ \hline
T & T & $\phi$ \\
T & $\phi$ & $\phi$ \\
$\phi$ & T & $\phi$ \\
$\phi$ & $\phi$ & T 
\end{tabular}
\medskip

Find an expression for $(A\, \land \lnot B) \lor C$
using only these new connectives (as well as negation and the
variable symbols themselves).

\item \label{IKK} The famous logician \index{Smullyan, Raymond} Raymond Smullyan devised 
a family of logical puzzles around a fictitious place he called 
\index{Knights and Knaves} ``the Island of Knights and Knaves.''  The inhabitants of the island are either knaves, who always make false statements, or knights, who always make truthful statements.  

In the most famous knight/knave puzzle, you are in a room which has only two exits.  One leads to certain death and the other to freedom.  There are two 
individuals in the room, and you know that one of them is a knight and the other is a knave, but you don't know which.   Your challenge is to determine the door which leads to freedom by asking a single question.
