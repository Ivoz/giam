\section{Equivalent sets}
\label{sec:equiv_sets}


\noindent{\large \bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}
\item Name four sets in the equivalence class of $\{1, 2, 3\}$.
\item Prove that set equivalence is an equivalence relation.
\item Construct a Venn diagram showing the relationships between the sets of
sets which are finite, infinite, countable, denumerable and uncountable.
\item Place the sets $\Naturals$, $\Reals$, $\Rationals$, $\Integers$, $\Integers \times \Integers$, $\Complexes$, $\Naturals_{2007}$ and $\emptyset$; 
somewhere on the Venn diagram above. (Note to students (and graders): 
there are no wrong answers to this question, the point is to see what 
your intuition about these sets says at this point.)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Examples of set equivalence}


\noindent{\large \bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Prove that positive numbers of the form $3k +1$ are equinumerous with
positive numbers of the form $4k + 2$.

\item Prove that $\displaystyle f(x) =  c + \frac{(x-a)(d-c)}{(b-a)}$ 
provides a bijection from the interval $[a, b]$ to the interval $[c, d]$.

\item Prove that any two circles are equinumerous (as sets of points).

\item Determine a formula for the bijection from $(-1, 1)$ to the line $y = 1$
determined by vertical projection onto the upper half of the unit circle,
followed by projection from the point $(0, 0)$.

\item  It is possible to generalize the argument that shows a line segment is
equivalent to a line to higher dimensions.   In two dimensions we would
show that the unit disk (the interior of the unit circle) is equinumerous
with the entire plane $\Reals \times \Reals$.   In three dimensions we would show that
the unit ball (the interior of the unit sphere) is equinumerous with the
entire space $\Reals^3 = \Reals \times \Reals \times \Reals$.  Here we 
would like you to prove the two-dimensional case.

Gnomonic projection is a style of map rendering in which a portion of a
sphere is projected onto a plane that is tangent to the sphere.  The 
sphere's center is used as the point to project from.  Combine 
vertical projection from the unit disk
in the x--y plane to the upper half of the unit sphere $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$,
with gnomonic projection from the unit sphere to the plane z = 1, to
deduce a bijection between the unit disk and the (infinite) plane.

\section{Cantor's theorem}
\label{sec:cantors_thm}



\noindent{\large \bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine a substitution rule -- a consistent way of replacing one digit
with another along the diagonal so that a diagonalization proof showing
that the interval (0, 1) is uncountable will work in decimal. Write up
the proof.

\item Can a diagonalization proof showing that the interval (0, 1) is uncountable
be made workable in base-3 (ternary) notation?

\item In the proof of Cantor's theorem we construct a set $S$ that cannot
be in the image of a presumed bijection from $A$ to ${\mathcal P}(A)$.  
Suppose $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and f determines the following correspondences: 
$1 \longleftrightarrow \emptyset$,
$2 \longleftrightarrow \{1, 3\}$ and $3 \longleftrightarrow \{1, 2, 3\}$. 
What is $S$?

\item An argument very similar to the one embodied in the proof of Cantor's
theorem is found in the Barber's paradox. This paradox was
originally introduced in the popular press in order to give laypeople an
understanding of Cantor's theorem and Russell's paradox. It sounds
somewhat sexist to modern ears. (For example, it is presumed without
comment that the Barber is male.)

\begin{quote}
In a small town there is a Barber who shaves those men (and
only those men) who do not shave themselves. Who shaves
the Barber?
\end{quote}

Explain the similarity to the proof of Cantor's theorem.

\item Cantor's theorem, applied to the set of all sets leads to an interesting
paradox. The power set of the set of all sets is a collection of sets, so
it must be contained in the set of all sets. Discuss the paradox and
determine a way of resolving it.

\item Verify that the final deduction in the proof of Cantor's theorem, 
``$(y \in S  \implies  y \notin S) \land  (y \notin S \implies y \in S)$,'' 
is truly a contradiction.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Dominance}



\noindent{\large \bf Exercises --- \thesection\ }

\begin{enumerate}
\item How could the clerk at the Hilbert Hotel accommodate a countable
number of new guests?
\item Let $F$ be the collection of all real-valued functions 
defined on the real line.  Find an injection from $\Reals$ to $F$.  Do you 
think it is possible to find an injection going the other way?  In 
other words, do you think that $F$ and $\Reals$ are equivalent?  Explain.
\item Fill in the details of the proof that dominance is an ordering relation.
(You may simply cite the C-B-S theorem in proving anti-symmetry.)
\item We can inject $\Rationals$ into $\Integers$ by sending 
$\displaystyle \pm \frac{a}{b}$ to $\displaystyle \pm 2^a3^b$.  
 Use this and another obvious injection to (in light of the C-B-S 
theorem) reaffirm the equivalence of these sets.
\end{enumerate}
