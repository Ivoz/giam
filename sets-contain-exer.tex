\begin{enumerate}
\item Insert either $\in$ or $\subseteq$ in the blanks in the following 
sentences (in order to produce true sentences).

\begin{tabular}{lcl}
\rule{0pt}{16pt}i) $1$ \underline{\rule{36pt}{0pt}} $\{3, 2, 1, \{a, b\}\}$ & \rule{36pt}{0pt} & iii) $\{a, b\}$  \underline{\rule{36pt}{0pt}} $\{3, 2, 1, \{a, b\}\}$ \\
\rule{0pt}{16pt}ii) $\{a\}$ \underline{\rule{36pt}{0pt}} $\{a, \{a, b\}\}$ & &
iv) $\{\{a, b\}\}$  \underline{\rule{36pt}{0pt}} $\{a, \{a, b\}\}$ \\
\end{tabular}

\item  Suppose that $p$ is a prime, for each $n$ in $\Integers^+$, 
define the set $P_n = \{ x \in \Integers^+ \suchthat \, p^n \divides x \}$.  
Conjecture and prove a statement about the containments between these sets.

\item  Provide a counterexample to dispel the notion that a subset must
have fewer elements than its superset.

\item  We have seen that $A \subseteq B$ corresponds to $M_A \implies M_B$.
What corresponds to the contrapositive statement?

\item Determine two sets $A$ and $B$ such that both of the sentences
$A \in B$ and $A \subseteq B$ are true.

\item Prove that the set of perfect fourth powers is contained in the
set of perfect squares.
