\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that if the cube of an integer is odd, then that integer is odd.

\item Prove that whenever a prime $p$ does not divide the square of an integer, 
it also doesn't divide the original integer. 
($p \nmid x^2 \; \implies \; p \nmid x$)

\item Prove (by contradiction) that there is no largest integer.

\item Prove (by contradiction) that there is no smallest positive real number.

\item Prove (by contradiction) that the sum of a rational and an irrational 
number is irrational.

\item Prove (by contraposition) that for all integers $x$ and $y$, if $x+y$ is odd, then $x\neq y$.

\item Prove (by contraposition) that for all real numbers $a$ and $b$, if $ab$ is irrational, then $a$
is irrational or $b$ is irrational.

\item A \index{Pythagorean triple}\emph{Pythagorean triple} is a set of three
natural numbers, $a$, $b$ and $c$, such that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.  Prove that, in a
Pythagorean triple, at least one of $a$ and $b$ is even.  Use either a proof by
contradiction or a proof by contraposition.

\item Suppose you have 2 pairs of real numbers whose products are 1.  That is, you have $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ in $\Reals^2$ satisfying $ab=cd=1$.  Prove that
$a < c$ implies that $b > d$.
